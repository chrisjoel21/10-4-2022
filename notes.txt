----->Stack
pop//delete -- need to check if it is empty
push//inserts -- need to check the size
we need integer type, arry size.
Stack is very benifical in reversing

extra_10_1_1 implement the stack


----->stack as template-is a sample u can use for u.
ex: int add(int x, int y);
    float add(float x,float y );

here we coukld use template
template <Class T>
T add(T x, T y){
    return (x+y)
}
if we have a int and float 

template<T,F>
T add(T x, F y);

extra_10_1_2
how to apply template in sasar.h
class name changed
calling has changed 
main includes sasar.cpp instead of sasar.h


---->stack as linkedlist (we will have nodes)
we will have the pointer as top;



push = addatbeg
pop = deletefromend

extra_10_1_3
mysatck.h
